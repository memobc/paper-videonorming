*Meta data for emotional news videos*


Videos are sorted by Mean Summary Valence Rating across subjects from low (most negative) to high (most positive).


Video_Continuous_Valence_data.xlsx:

Each column after 'Video Name' is the mean valence rating across subjects on a continuous scale of 1 (lowest) to 9 (highest) at each 0.5s time point in the video.
The maximum video length is 52 seconds, and time points are marked as NaN where videos are shorter.
Note that the rating marker started at a random point along the scale on each trial, so the mean at the beginning across subjects and/or videos should be ~5.
